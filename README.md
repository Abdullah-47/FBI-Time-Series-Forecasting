# FBI Time Series Forecasting

Welcome to the **FBI Time Series Forecasting** project! This repository contains production-grade Jupyter Notebooks focused on time series forecasting using FBI crime or related datasets.

## Overview

This project leverages modern forecasting techniques to analyze and predict patterns in FBI time series data. It is designed for accuracy, scalability, and reproducibility, making it suitable for both research and production environments.

## Features

- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** Clean and visualize FBI time series datasets to extract meaningful features.
- **Model Development:** Implementation of advanced forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, etc.).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Rigorous model validation using standard time series metrics (MAE, RMSE, etc.).
- **Visualization:** Interactive and static plots for in-depth analysis of trends, seasonality, and forecasts.
- **Production-Ready Notebooks:** Modular, well-documented code that can be easily adapted for other time series forecasting tasks.

## Repository Structure

```
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and evaluation
├── data/                # Data files (not included in repo, see below)
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

> **Note:** There are no requirements files included. Please ensure your environment has the necessary libraries (see below).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdullah-47/FBI-Time-Series-Forecasting.git
   ```

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - This project assumes you have a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook support.
   - Commonly used libraries include: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `prophet`, `tensorflow/keras` (if deep learning is used).
   - You can install these with:
     ```bash
     pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels prophet tensorflow
     ```
   - Adjust packages as needed based on your notebook’s imports.

3. **Data Files:**
   - **Data is not included.** Please acquire FBI time series data (e.g., from the official FBI Crime Data Explorer or other sources) and place it in the `data/` directory.
   - Update notebook paths as necessary.

4. **Run Notebooks:**
   - Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory with Jupyter and follow the step-by-step instructions.

## Usage

- Explore the notebooks to understand data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and forecasting.
- Modify the code to experiment with other datasets or forecasting methods.
